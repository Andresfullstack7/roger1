      <h1>Dear Roger,</h1>
      <p class="message">Ever since we last met in Milan on that magical December evening, not a day has passed where I haven't thought of you. We have talked every day, sharing our hopes, dreams, and fears, and our connection has only grown stronger. As we sit here together after a romantic dinner, I am filled with a sense of happiness and contentment that only comes from being with you. Every moment we spend together, my love for you deepens, and I know without a doubt that I want to spend the rest of my life by your side.</p>
